##### RIGID FRAME STEEL BUILDINGS
<hr/>

Structural steel frames can be designed to meet any height and span provided
engineered feasibility is maintained. Brytex structural steel framed buildings
are engineered and designed to meet our customer’s specific requirements. Some
features that Brytex has incorporated into our customers’ structural steel
framed buildings included large-sized framed openings, equipment supports,
suspension requirements, overhead cranes, monorails, vertical lift doors, and
cooling towers.

Tapered structural steel frames are used to provide our customers with large
unobstructed spans with greater economy. One or both gable end frames can be
post and beam construction to reduce costs even further. The structural steel
frames can utilize any of our wall and roof systems, building accessories, and
equipment to provide a complete and functional building.

Conventional mill section structural steel frames are available as an
alternative to the tapered.

##### SKID MOUNTED STEEL BUILDINGS
<hr/>

Brytex produces skid mounted steel buildings that are engineered and designed
to meet our customers’ specific requirements. Many of the skid mounted
buildings that Brytex has produced have structural steel frames and heavy-duty
skids that accommodate heavy loads and maintain rigid structural integrity when
being transported or moved. Brytex has produced many of these buildings that
have included sophisticated electrical and HVAC systems.

##### SELF FRAMING STEEL BUILDINGS

The Brytex Self Framing Gable Type building is an economical system with a
clear span of up to 11.5 meters, depending on the local structural design
criteria. Engineered design allows easy assembly of all building components
with a minimum of steel supports.

The Brytex Self Framing Shed Type building consists of a simple structural
design and single roof span from wall to wall without the need for interior
steel bracing providing maximum space.
